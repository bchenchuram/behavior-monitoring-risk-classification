Behavior Monitoring and Risk Classification

WHAT: Project Overview

This project provides an automated machine learning solution for behavior monitoring and risk classification in financial transactions. It addresses the need for real-time fraud detection and risk management by classifying transactions based on learned behavior patterns. The solution allows financial institutions to proactively monitor transactions, detect anomalies, and reduce manual intervention in identifying suspicious activities.

WHY: Problem Statement

Financial institutions face increasing challenges in managing risks and complying with regulations. Traditional fraud detection is labor-intensive and reactive, leading to delays in identifying high-risk transactions. This project solves these issues by:
	•	Automating Risk Classification: Classifying transactions in real-time based on behavior patterns.
	•	Reducing Operational Costs: Minimizing the need for manual reviews.
	•	Supporting Compliance: Enhancing regulatory adherence by providing a robust monitoring solution.

This approach enables institutions to manage risks more efficiently, address fraud proactively, and improve the scalability of their operations.

HOW: Solution Overview

The solution consists of three primary stages:
	1.	Data Preprocessing: Cleanses, transforms, and engineers new features from transactional data.
	2.	Model Training: Uses machine learning algorithms to learn from historical data and classify transactions.
	3.	Real-Time Evaluation: Assigns risk scores to new transactions, enabling real-time classification as low or high risk.

Below is a sequence diagram to illustrate the process flow.

Each step in this diagram corresponds to stages in the main script (main.py), which processes, trains, and evaluates the data.

Data

	•	Dataset: A CSV file (transactions.csv) simulating transactional data, used to detect and classify risky behavior.
	•	Data Columns:
	•	transaction_id: Unique ID for each transaction.
	•	user_id: Unique ID for each user.
	•	transaction_amount: Transaction amount in currency.
	•	transaction_time: Timestamp of transaction.
	•	location: Geographic location of transaction.
	•	risk_label: Target label for risk (0 = low risk, 1 = high risk).


Setup Instructions
